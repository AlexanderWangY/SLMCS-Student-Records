# SLMCS-HomeWork
This was homework for SLMCS Coding Club (Web Development Practice).
I used Java on the IntelliJ IDE.

The task was to seperate the two CSV files and compare student IDs to see how many classes they were taking.

The final.txt and the final.csv is the output with "English_Name" and "Number_Of_Classes" as the columns.
